# Khroma
Restore colour to the world by battling your way through 4 enemy-riddled maps. Battles feature minigames inspired by Geometry Dash, Fruit Ninja, and Undertale. 

CONTROLS:
Move around the map using:
W -> UP
A -> LEFT
S -> DOWN
D -> RIGHT
Controls for each minigame are shown on each of their respective pre-game instructions. 

SAVING/LOADING:
In the start screen, you have the choice to start a new game or load a pre-existing game file. The game can be saved anytime outside of the minigames. 

GAME MECHANICS:
The first 3 maps each contain 3 enemies with the same minigame which progressively gets harder further along the path. The final boss map is a mashup of all three minigames at a harder difficulty. You can only progress to the next map when all three enemies have been defeated.
